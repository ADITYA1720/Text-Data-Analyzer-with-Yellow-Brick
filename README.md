# Text-Data-Analyzer-with-Yellow-Brick

Analyzing Text Data with Yellowbrick. Tasks such as assessing document similarity, topic modelling and other text mining endeavors are predicated on the notion of "closeness" or "similarity" between documents. We define various distance metrics (e.g. Euclidean, Hamming, Cosine, Manhattan, etc) and understand their merits and shortcomings as they relate to document similarity. 
We apply these metrics on documents within a specific corpus and visualize our results.
